# EyeSpy Capture - Background

A simple and elegant tool which enables one to retrieve a screnshot of a subdomain without any headless browser technology. It leverages on Google API to take screenshot of the subdomain, the downside of this is that the screenshot has a fixed size of 320x179. 

While working on a different personal OSINT project, I discovered a guide written by P.Kumar and decided to implement this to EyeSpy Capture. Shout out to that guy!

## Getting Started

This is tested on python Python 2.7.15rc1 and no this is not a fail-proof script, I hacked this together in 2 days. I just need it to work just right.
